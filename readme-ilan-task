The project is running on minikube on Windows 10 pro machine.
Virtualbox was installed since docker image is not working with k8 "nodePort"
You should also set enough memory (the default is 2048)

The idea was to send a fully automated package.

To make it work I take the following steps:

Jenkins is running with an helm chart with JCasc (unfortunatly JCasc configuration couldn't upload)
However, the plugins and login user name are automatically installed.

Sonarqube is also running with helm chart and some different values to run it on minikube.

Nexus deployed via "regual" deployment manifest.

The Jenkins file use Kubernetes plugin in order to run the build process inside containers.
